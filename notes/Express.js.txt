What is express.js? -it is a web development framework.

What so the difference between a framework and a library?
A framework is a bunch of code which you use that someone else has written for you much like a library.
However,unlike a library we have less control of a framework and we use to develop applications fast.


ROUTING USING EXPRESS:
 var express=require("express");//so variable express now contains all the contents of the 'express 'directory
 
var app=express();//saving it to a variable called app.js
 
 
// '/'='hi there'
 //this is how we define routing
 
//the first param defines the route and the second is a callback function which takes
// a request and response object

app.get("/",function(req,res)
{
  res.send("hi from express"});
 


//  '/hello'='hello world'
 
 
app.get("/hello",function(req,res)
{
 res.send("hello hello heloo is anybody in there?")
   })
 
 
//  '/bye'="goodbye brother"
 
app.get("/bye",function(req,res)
{
  res.send("goodbye crazy ass ");
 })

 

 
 
//tell express to listen for requests(start server)
 

 app.listen(process.env.PORT,process.env.IP,function(){
 console.log("server started");
 });



#NPM Init and Package.json:

Package.json-containsa bunch of metadata about a particualr application or package.
'npm init' helps us create a new package.json file:
fill in the questions in the terminal and a new package.json file will be created for you.Howver,this
file won't have the dependency property.In roder to do that you use: npm install 'package name' --save

after this the pakage.json file will look like this:
{
  "name": "packagejsondemo",
  
"version": "1.0.0",
 
 "description": "simple package.json demo",
  
"main": "app.js",
  

"scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  
"author": "akash",
  
"license": "ISC",
  
"dependencies":
 {
 "cat-me": "^1.0.2",
    //to add this we wrote  npm install cat-me --save(this automatically got added
                          //to the dependency property
"express": "^4.13.4",
    
"faker": "^3.1.0"
  }
}


in short we use --save to save the package that we are installing to 
the dependency property of the package.json file.
