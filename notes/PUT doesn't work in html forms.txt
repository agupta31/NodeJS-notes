PUT & DEELTE REQUESTS DONT WORK INT HTML FORMS-IT IS DEFAULTED TO GET.

The solution to this is use something called a method override.
we install npm method-override package.

and while defining our forms we add:?_method=PUT 
  <form class="ui form" action="/blogs/<%=blogData._id%>?_method=PUT" method="POST">

Whenever the method-overrride package sees this command it submits the form to the method specified (PUT)
in this case.
