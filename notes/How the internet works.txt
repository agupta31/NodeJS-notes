http://www.udemy.com/courses-example of a typical http request

www.udemy.com is the name of the server.

courses refers to the data/page that we are looking for

http: tells us that it is a http request


First thing that happens when we type this in our browser is that the browser looks for the ip address
of that server.www.udemy.com will have a specific ip adress such as 123.23.56.89. 

After finding that address it tells the server that it wants some info regarding 'courses'.The server typically
searches for that in the database and sends its response in a http response which is nothing but a combination
of html,css and some javascript.

This page then gets rendered to us on the browser.



STATIC VS DYNAMIC WEBPAGES:

STATIC-The server sends the same webpage everytime you send it a particular request.The data sent back is 
the same.

DYNAMIC:the server dynamically adds/removes/modifies content  on the fly and sends a different response
everytime you sent it a request.Eg.the reddit page.Everytime it loads a different content. 



DIFFERENT HTTP VERBS:
GET-when we want to retrieve some data.
POST-when we want to add some data to the database(eg..a form)
PUT
PATCH
DELETE
